        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I graduated high school on the principal's honor roll and was captain of two teams. I served a total of 3 collective years of leadership experience as well as being one of 30 students chosen to represent the school in the student senate as an ambassador for students' voices. I am a bilingual, first generation Mexican American and it was my mission to help bring more cultural appreciation towards the world of traditional indigenous Mexican dance.<br><br>

        Currently I work as a teachers assistant in a children's care facility specializing in the age group of 3-5 year olds. My duties include redirecting behaviors, encouraging exploration, developing their fine motor skills and guiding them with reading and writing.  I really enjoy my job and in the future I aim to work with children as a social worker so this type of career will greatly benefit from my experience. On occasion I also nanny for a family from the preschool. My responsibilities there are to care for the children: ages three, eight, and eleven. I pick them up from school and to and from extracurriculars as well as assisting with homework and preparing the family dinner. I think after I finish college I will take a year off and further my relationship with this family and become a full time nanny for a year to save up money for a new car. <br><br>
        
        Prior to these jobs in the childcare industry, I worked in the food service industry. I was a seasonal host at The Cheesecake Factory and stayed there for about three months. This job was very demanding and honestly being around toddlers who constantly throw tantrums does not compare to it. It was a great learning experience and I have developed a profound sense of appreciation for food service workers after being there for a mere 12 weeks. This job included duties such as greeting customers, seating parties, cleaning and restocking restrooms, and the long list of jobs that were not in the job description yet were still required. Some of these unofficial jobs I had to take up on busy days were bussing tables, taking orders, running food, starting tables with bread and drinks, cleaning windows, and pushing together large heavy tables to accommodate bigger parties.It was my first job and I believe that was a big reason as to why I was hired as I was naive to what a workplace environment should look like. I was constantly harassed for my appearance by the house manager and when I asked my coworkers (who were also young college aged girls) they said that it was just the way things were around there. Since then I have learned to value myself more and ask a lot of questions in the hiring process to see exactly what the work culture in the prospective new job looks like. I look forward to the opportunities that the future holds with this new found self assurance and I know that I will be able to be more successful in an environment that I feel shares my values
